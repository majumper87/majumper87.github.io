# Self Assessment

I started out by first obtaining IT certifications - CompTIA A+ and Network+. As I continued to learned more, my thirst for knowledge led me to want to obtain a degree in Computer Science. The Computer Science course program has opened more doors than I know to walk through. Even in this ePortfolio, it only showcases use of Python, HTML, C# and XAML, MongoDB, and SQL. These are just a few of the examples of languages that I worked with in my time with SNHU.
